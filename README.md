# SparseREMapping

## Paper information

- **Title**: Enhancing 3D sparse reconstruction accuracy of scour terrain with gradient window and edge reprojection approach
- **Journal**: Measurement
- **Status**: Submitted

### Project Structure



This project consists of two main parts:

1. Open to on-site scour terrain RGB images, laser terrain(Terrain.ply) and  sparse reconstructed point cloud(model.ply) in ***data***.
2. terrain-reconstructed algorithms  written in python, contain *SFM*, *KNN-Linear*,  *Gradient* and *SparseREMapping* modules in ***code***



### Future Plans



- Complete software copyright registration for the SparseREMapping
- Consider full open-source release
- Maintain modular structure for flexible integration of different prediction and measurement methods

### Stay Tuned



We will release:

- Implementation of the Wave-ETKF algorithm
- Example configurations
